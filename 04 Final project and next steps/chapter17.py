# The path forward (runnable checklist)
# Checklist:

# Style: Install and run ruff and black on your codebase.

# Tests: Add pytest tests for core functions (pure functions are easiest).

# Types: Run mypy on your functions; tighten signatures.

# Docs: Add docstrings with examples.

# Refactor: Identify any function doing “too much” and split it.

# Next patterns:

# Itertools: groupby, accumulate, pairwise.

# I/O: CSV/JSON robust handling.

# Async basics: asyncio for I/O-bound tasks.
